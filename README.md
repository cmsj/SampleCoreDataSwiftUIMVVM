# SampleCoreDataSwiftUIMVVM
An attempt to build a reasonably complex example of mixing SwiftUI with MVVM and Core Data.

This is based very heavily on the work of Alex Zarr:

 * https://github.com/alexzarr/DemoTodoList/tree/tutorial_part_5_core_data

Right now, a lot of the data doesn't get updated properly as its edited. If you understand why, please feel free to submit a pull request üòÅ
(Similarly, if you think this whole thing could be done in a better way, I'd love to discuss it with you in an Issue or via email!)
